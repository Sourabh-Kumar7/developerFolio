You have a list of everyone\u2019s email addresses (Emails table) and another list with their phone numbers (Phones table). But wait! How do you match the email addresses with the corresponding phone numbers? This is where joins come\u00a0in!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jThOoRiBVTaQyPxxzhDmSA.png\"><figcaption>Joins</figcaption></figure><p>In the world of databases, joins are like matchmakers for your data. They allow you to combine information from separate tables based on a common field, creating a more complete picture. Let\u2019s explore different types of joins using relatable examples:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2vNkCeMnDYZLcAYjTyGz2g.png\"><figcaption>Types of\u00a0joins</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Inner Join: The Perfect\u00a0Match</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to our reunion. An inner join would only return results where there\u2019s a match in both tables. So, you\u2019d get a list with email addresses alongside only those phone numbers that have a corresponding email address. This is perfect when you only need data points that exist in both\u00a0tables.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> An online store might have a \u201cCustomers\u201d table and an \u201cOrders\u201d table. An inner join would show customer details only for those with confirmed orders.</p>\n<p><strong>The Left Join: Including Everyone, Even the\u00a0Singles</strong></p>\n<p>Think of your reunion guest list again. Maybe some friends haven\u2019t shared their phone numbers yet. A left join would include all email addresses from the Emails table, even if there\u2019s no matching phone number in the Phones table. In those cases, the phone number field would show as\u00a0blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> A library might have a \u201cBooks\u201d table and a \u201cBorrowers\u201d table. A left join would show all books, including those that haven\u2019t been borrowed yet (with a borrower field showing as\u00a0blank).</p>\n<p><strong>The Right Join: Don\u2019t Forget the Other\u00a0Side</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps you also have a separate list of phone numbers for some old classmates you haven\u2019t emailed in a while. A right join would prioritize the Phones table, showing all phone numbers, even if there\u2019s no corresponding email address. Emails for those contacts would be\u00a0blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> A music streaming service might have a \u201cUsers\u201d table and a \u201cPlaylists\u201d table. A right join would show all playlists, including those created by users who haven\u2019t signed up yet (with a username field showing as\u00a0blank).</p>\n<p><strong>The Full Outer Join: The Whole\u00a0Picture</strong></p>\n<p>Going back to the reunion, maybe you want a complete list that includes everyone, regardless of whether they provided both email and phone number.

You have a list of everyone\u2019s email addresses (Emails table) and another list with their phone numbers (Phones table). But wait! How do you match the email addresses with the corresponding phone numbers? This is where joins come\u00a0in!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jThOoRiBVTaQyPxxzhDmSA.png\"><figcaption>Joins</figcaption></figure><p>In the world of databases, joins are like matchmakers for your data. They allow you to combine information from separate tables based on a common field, creating a more complete picture. Let\u2019s explore different types of joins using relatable examples:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2vNkCeMnDYZLcAYjTyGz2g.png\"><figcaption>Types of\u00a0joins</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Inner Join: The Perfect\u00a0Match</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to our reunion. An inner join would only return results where there\u2019s a match in both tables. So, you\u2019d get a list with email addresses alongside only those phone numbers that have a corresponding email address. This is perfect when you only need data points that exist in both\u00a0tables.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> An online store might have a \u201cCustomers\u201d table and an \u201cOrders\u201d table. An inner join would show customer details only for those with confirmed orders.</p>\n<p><strong>The Left Join: Including Everyone, Even the\u00a0Singles</strong></p>\n<p>Think of your reunion guest list again. Maybe some friends haven\u2019t shared their phone numbers yet. A left join would include all email addresses from the Emails table, even if there\u2019s no matching phone number in the Phones table. In those cases, the phone number field would show as\u00a0blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> A library might have a \u201cBooks\u201d table and a \u201cBorrowers\u201d table. A left join would show all books, including those that haven\u2019t been borrowed yet (with a borrower field showing as\u00a0blank).</p>\n<p><strong>The Right Join: Don\u2019t Forget the Other\u00a0Side</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps you also have a separate list of phone numbers for some old classmates you haven\u2019t emailed in a while. A right join would prioritize the Phones table, showing all phone numbers, even if there\u2019s no corresponding email address. Emails for those contacts would be\u00a0blank.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-life example:</strong> A music streaming service might have a \u201cUsers\u201d table and a \u201cPlaylists\u201d table. A right join would show all playlists, including those created by users who haven\u2019t signed up yet (with a username field showing as\u00a0blank).</p>\n<p><strong>The Full Outer Join: The Whole\u00a0Picture</strong></p>\n<p>Going back to the reunion, maybe you want a complete list that includes everyone, regardless of whether they provided both email and phone number.
